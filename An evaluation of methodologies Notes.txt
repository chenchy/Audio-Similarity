Similarity between short art clips of indian music.
Task involves :-
extraction of relevent melodic representations from audio singanls and appropriate choice of representation.
The similarity measure should be invariant of pitch transpositions and global tempo variations. 
For hindustani music, extracts semi-automatically generated predominant pitch contours.
Convert pitch values from Hertz to Cents, to make representation musically more relevant.
Analyze the effect of various sampling rates on representation.
	
Transposition invariance :
5 techniqes tested to achieve transposition invariance
1> normalizing pitch values by the tonic ferq of the lead artist. Considering it as the base freq in Hertz to Cents
2> Zero mean normalization
3> Zero median normalization
4> Z-Normalization
5> Median Absolute Deviation Normalization

Experimentation with quantizing the pitch values. Quantization in semitone level and and quarter tone level

Uniform Time Scaling:
Typical approach is to consider multiple uniformly time-scaled versions of the patterns. 
Can be done using interpolation. Cubic interpolation is used.

Similarity Computation:
Two catagories of commonly used distance measures: 
Euclidian distance : Non parametric distance measure. 
Dynamic Time Warping based distance : has many variants and parameters to select. Whole Sequence matching DTW used with two possibilities of local constraints- 1> without local constraints 2> with local constraints
